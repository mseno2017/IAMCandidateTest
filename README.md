# IAM Candidate Test Application

## Overview

The IAM (Identity and Access Management) team has an opening for a developer to take a role on the forefront of modernizing the ASTRA application, which is central to the University of Washington's authorization system.

The application is built using ASP.NET Web Forms and runs on .NET Framework 4.0.

The modernization effort involves a greenfield project that will recreate all of the functionality of the existing application using the latest web technology stack from Microsoft.  That is currently .NET 6 and ASP.NET Core 6.

A strong understanding of WebForms is required for this role.  Although the project's requirements will be defined and tracked formally, the soon-to-be legacy application will need to be used as a technical reference.

This test is a microcosm of the development one will need to do in this position.

Please read and follow the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md) carefully.
